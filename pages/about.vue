            About Bill's PC
          </template>
          <p>
          Bill's PC is a Discord Bot, that is very different than other Discord Bots. It tries to break
          a barrier of reality that any bot can be such a viable tool outside of Discord. Bill's PC is not "my bot",
          It's "ours". Bill's PC is a Community Bot. A Community bot is completely different than most bots, the reason
          is that Community bots are as strong as its community. The community is what makes the bot, makes it to be what it is,
          The community can shape it as however they wish, to benefit them, and others. Thats why Bill's PC was made to be a Community bot.
